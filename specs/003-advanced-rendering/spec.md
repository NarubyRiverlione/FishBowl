# Spec 003: Advanced Rendering & Tank Design

**Status**: 📋 Draft  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

## Overview

This specification covers advanced rendering features, circular tank shapes, multi-tank display systems, and enhanced physics simulation for the FishBowl game.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Circular tank shape implementation
- Multi-tank display grid system
- Advanced physics simulation
- Enhanced rendering pipeline
- Tank design customization

### Out of Scope

- Fish breeding mechanics (covered in spec-004)
- Core game mechanics (completed in spec-001)
- Basic tank functionality (completed in spec-001)

## Features

### F001: Circular Tank Shape

- Circular boundary collision detection
- Visual circular tank rendering
- Physics adaptation for round boundaries

### F002: Multi-Tank Display

- Grid-based tank layout system
- Tank switching interface
- Independent tank simulation

### F003: Enhanced Physics

- Improved collision detection
- Smooth fish movement
- Performance optimization

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Circular tanks render correctly with proper boundaries
- [ ] Multi-tank system supports 2-4 tanks simultaneously
- [ ] Performance maintains 60fps with multiple active tanks
- [ ] Visual quality improvements are noticeable
- [ ] All existing functionality remains intact

## Notes

This spec contains tasks moved from specs/001-core-mechanics/tasks.md Phase 4 to maintain focused scope in the core mechanics MVP.
