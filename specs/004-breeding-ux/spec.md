# Spec 004: Fish Breeding & Enhanced UX

**Status**: 📋 Draft  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 weeks

## Overview

This specification covers fish breeding mechanics, genetic systems, enhanced user experience features, and advanced fish management for the FishBowl game.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Fish breeding and genetics system
- Breeding UI and animations
- Enhanced fish selection and management
- Advanced feeding mechanics
- Fish personality and behavior traits

### Out of Scope

- Tank rendering systems (covered in spec-003)
- Core game mechanics (completed in spec-001)
- Basic fish lifecycle (completed in spec-001)

## Features

### F001: Breeding System

- Fish pairing and breeding mechanics
- Genetic trait inheritance
- Breeding cooldowns and requirements

### F002: Genetics & Traits

- Color and pattern inheritance
- Size and growth rate genetics
- Personality trait system

### F003: Enhanced UX

- Improved fish selection interface
- Breeding animations and feedback
- Advanced info panels

### F004: Fish Behavior

- Personality-based movement patterns
- Social interactions between fish
- Advanced feeding behaviors

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Fish can successfully breed with genetic inheritance
- [ ] Breeding UI is intuitive and engaging
- [ ] Genetic traits are visually distinguishable
- [ ] Enhanced UX improves player engagement
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal

## Notes

This spec contains tasks moved from specs/001-core-mechanics/tasks.md Phase 5 to maintain focused scope in the core mechanics MVP.
