# feeding
Food will be bought and added on top of the water surface.

The more hunger a fish is the faster it will swim to the food.
When a fish is at the location of the food it will consume it (remove food from tank)
Then the fish will dive to eat the food (and make place for other fish to find food)

Fish will have different hunger requirements based on there age and size
- jong and small : 1 piece
- mature and medium : 3 pieces
- old and big : 5 pieces

When after eating a food the fish still has hunger then it will look for more food.
