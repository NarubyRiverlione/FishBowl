# collision

bowl collision detection : flat bottom and changed water line

z-order check, color of fish seams change, are the draw below the water

- after changing random direction it seams fish can be rendered upside down (eye below the mouth)
- pause stops the ticker but fish keep swimming

# health

- health should regenerate (slowly), of course not above 100M
- health = 0 = dead but doesn't remove the fish at the moment; is that a feature for later ?
- fish do go from youth to mature but don't visible grow, they do have different size in dev mode where there spawned in a different age lifecycle

# message bar
