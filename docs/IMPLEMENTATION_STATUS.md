## Planned Features (Not Yet Implemented)

### Milestone 3: Breeding System (Planned)

**Objective**: Implement fish genetics, life cycle, and reproduction mechanics.

**Planned Features** (from PRD.md):

- Fish genetics and inheritance
- Life cycle stages:
  - Young (fry): Vulnerable, hides, grows fast
  - Adult: Fertile, full size, sellable
  - Old: Fertility decreases, health declines
- Breeding mechanics:
  - Mate selection
  - Egg laying and hatching
  - Genetic inheritance (dominant/recessive traits)
  - Mutations for special fish
- Gender and fertility
- Death mechanics (health = 0)

**Status**: Not started

### Milestone 4: Advanced Environment & Water Quality (Planned)

**Objective**: Extend water quality simulation with advanced mechanics.

**Planned Features** (from PRD.md):

- Enhanced water quality:
  - Biomass-based pollution (large fish pollute more)
  - Food particle system (uneaten food increases pollution)
  - Stress mechanics affecting fish health and breeding
- Advanced maintenance:
  - Filter cleaning requirement
  - Water change mechanics (locks feeding temporarily)
- Oxygen management:
  - Fish consume oxygen based on size
  - Surface agitation, oxygen pumps, plants provide oxygen
  - Oxygen deficiency → rapid health decline
- Plants and decoration:
  - Living plants (reduce pollution, provide hiding spots, can die)
  - Decorative items (stress reduction, breeding sites)

## Architecture Overview

**Current Stack**:

- React 19 + Vite 7 (UI framework & build tool)
- TypeScript 5.9 (strict mode)
- Pixi.js 8 (rendering engine)
- Vitest (unit/integration testing)
- Playwright (E2E testing)
- pnpm (package manager)

**Project Structure**:

```
src/
├── types/         # TypeScript interfaces
├── models/        # Domain logic (Fish, Tank)
├── lib/           # Utilities (physics, collision, random)
├── game/          # Pixi.js rendering (sprites, views, engine)
├── components/    # React UI (canvas wrapper)
└── assets/        # Graphics (SVG fish sprite)
```

**Architecture Pattern**: Separation of Concerns

- Models: Pure TypeScript logic, no rendering
- Game: Pixi.js rendering, observes models
- Components: React UI, thin wrapper layer
- Lib: Stateless utility functions
